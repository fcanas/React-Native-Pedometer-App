Install React Native according to Facebook's instructions, and make a new project.

`react-native init Pedometer` creates a new React Native project.

React Native gives you a live programming environment when you run the generated
Xcode project. Run the project, and the applicaiton will run. Command-R will
reload your application from source.

step count right in the middle of the screen. Maybe a little instruction, or
labeling might be in order. So We'll edit the screen's JSX and styles to roughly
fit that vision.
